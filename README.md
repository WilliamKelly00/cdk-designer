# Overview

This project converts architecture diagrams into fully functional AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) code, making infrastructure-as-code (IaC) deployment seamless and automated. By analyzing architectural representations, the tool generates CDK stacks that are ready to be deployed in AWS environments.

Features

- Diagram Parsing: Extracts infrastructure components from architecture diagrams.

- CDK Code Generation: Converts extracted components into AWS CDK constructs.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Ensures consistent and reproducible deployments.

- Customizable Templates: Supports modifications to generated CDK code.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
